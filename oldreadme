jQuery Image Stream Widget
@author Stephen Koo
@version 0.1.1

This is a jQuery UI widget that can display and animate a sequence of images on the web. 
Images are dynamically loaded on demand, with some buffering when playing the animation.
One particularly nifty feature is the ability to supply multiple versions of the image sequence,
with different resolutions, which Image Stream automatically swaps in and out as you change the size
of the image, or as slower network conditions require (somewhat like adaptive bitrate streaming for video).

REQUIREMENTS
jQuery and jQuery UI (or more specifically the jQuery Ui widget factory) must be sourced on the same page.
(Tested on jQuery 2.0.2 and jQuery UI 1.10.3)
Image Stream also relies on the HTML5 Canvas and so may not work on some older browsers.

NOTES/GOTCHAS
Image Stream internally uses zero-indexing for the images, so all methods taking image indices assume you are too.

OPTIONS
@param images           -   array of images that are played in this order ! important image names may not contain any spaces
@param sequence         -   string like image####.jpg which automatically fills the images array,
                                    image#.jpg would render like image123.jpg
                                    image#####.jpg would render like image00123.jpg ! important image names may not contain any spaces
@param from             -   integer value that defines the start of the sequence
@param to               -   integer value that defines the end of the sequence
@param folder           -   string that contains the image folder
@param startAt          -   the sequence number of the image to load and display first
@param fps              -   float value that represents the frames per second rate
@param containerWidth   -   integer value in pixels to which the the player frame width is scaled
@param containerHeight  -   integer value in pixels to which the the player frame height is scaled
@param width            -   integer value in pixels to which the image width is scaled
@param height           -   integer value in pixels to which the image height is scaled
@param xOffset          -   horizontal offset of the image in pixels
@param yOffset          -   vertical offset of the image in pixels
@param maxBufferSize    -   the maximum number of images to keep in buffer while animating
@param minBufferSize    -   the minimum number of images to wait for load before beginning animation

METHODS (see method definitions for more details)
init        - $(".movie").imageStream({});   // initializes the plugin on the target element(s) with default settings 
            - $(".movie").imageStream({fps: 24}); // initializes the plugin on the target element(s) while overriding defaults with fps = 24
option      - $(".movie").imageStream("option", "fps", 24); // sets a value in the settings (not recommended for now as changes will not necessarily be flected in subsequence behavior)
play        - $(".movie").imageStream("play");    // starts the animation at the current frame, or the beginning if currently at the end
            - $(".movie").imageStream("play", 1, 80);       // plays the animation from frame 1 until frame 80
pause       - $(".movie").imageStream("pause");   // pauses the animation
next        - $(".movie").imageStream("next");    // goes to the next image in the sequence
previous    - $(".movie").imageStream("previous");          // goes to the previous image in the sequence
goto        - $(".movie").imageStream("goto", 20);          // goes to frame 20 in the sequence
setSize     - $(".movie").imageStream("setSize", 360, 480); // scales the image to 360x480 pixels
setOffset   - $(".movie").imageStream("setOffset", 13, 37); // moves the image to (13, 37) within the frame

EVENTS
play        - is triggered when the animation starts playing
pause       - is triggered when the animation pauses
changeFrame - is triggered when the animation changes frame, and the new frame number is passed as an argument to the handler
buffering   - is triggered when the animation waits for the images to buffer
