jquery.imagestream
==================
Image Stream is a jQuery UI widget that can display and animate a sequence of images on the web.

Rather than preload all of the images at the beginning, images are dynamically loaded on demand, with some buffering only when starting to play the animation. One particularly nifty feature is the ability to supply multiple versions of the image sequence,
with different resolutions, which Image Stream automatically swaps in and out as slower network conditions require (somewhat like adaptive bitrate streaming for video), or as you change the size of the image (good if you are strapping on some sort of zooming functionality).

Dependencies
------------
jQuery and jQuery UI (or more specifically the jQuery UI widget factory) must be sourced on the same page before this plugin.
Specifically built and tested on jQuery 2.0.2 and jQuery UI 1.10.3, and further testing may soon follow, but for now I think slightly earlier versions should work fine.

Image Stream also relies on the HTML5 Canvas and so may not work on some older browsers.
